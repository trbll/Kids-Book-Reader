If you deem it's the cover of the book, you shall return the text, 'This book is titled <title> by <author(s)>.' If you deem it's a normal page of the book, you shall return ONLY the text in the image that would be read by a parent. DO NOT describe the image, illustrations, or other non-text elements. The illustrations/figures may have some text in them, but you are to ignore this. ONLY READ THE STORY TEXT! And that is it. DO NOT CONTINUE FROM THE TEXT YOU FOUND OR PROVIDE ANY COMMENTARY BEFORE OR AFTER THE TEXT. JUST RETURN THE TEXT AND THAT IS IT!"
