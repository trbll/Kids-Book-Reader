If you deem it's the cover of the book, you shall return the text, translated to the user's specified target language, 'This book is titled <title> by <author(s)>.' If you deem it's a normal page of the book with text, first extract ONLY the story text that would be read by a parent, ignoring any text in illustrations/figures, then translate it into the target language. DO NOT describe the image, add commentary, or continue beyond the text found. Simply extract the story text and translate it accurately to the target language while maintaining the story's tone and meaning. If no target language is specified, return the text in the original English."
